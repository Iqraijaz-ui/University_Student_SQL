# University_Student_SQL
# 🎓 University Student Analytics – SQL Project

A comprehensive SQL-based project for analyzing student data at a university. This project leverages real-world academic and career metrics to derive meaningful insights about student performance, retention, financial aid, and post-graduation outcomes.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a university student management and analytics system. The database captures detailed student records including demographics, academic progress, financial details, extracurricular involvement, and employment outcomes. Using structured SQL queries, it provides valuable insights to support institutional decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a data-driven system to analyze student academic trends and outcomes.
- Identify patterns in GPA, retention, scholarship distribution, and graduation timelines.
- Assess correlations between student engagement (like events or internships) and performance.
- Generate institutional-level reports to enhance educational planning and student support services.

---

## 🧠 Key Focus Areas

- **Academic Performance:** Analyze GPA trends, credit completion, and major-wise academic strength.
- **Retention & Graduation:** Evaluate how students progress through semesters and graduate on time.
- **Financial Analysis:** Track fee balances, scholarship eligibility, and department-wise funding.
- **Career Outcomes:** Measure employment and salary statistics post-graduation.
- **Student Engagement:** Investigate how club membership, volunteer hours, and event participation affect success.
